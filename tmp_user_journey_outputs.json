Some hearts are hard, some are shallow, some are crowded, and some are ready. If we are honest, each of us has known seasons of all four. The hard heart hears truth but dismisses it. The shallow heart responds with emotion but has no root when suffering comes. The crowded heart welcomes Jesus but refuses to uproot rival loves. But the good soil receives the word, holds it fast, and bears fruit with patience. So the question today is not whether the seed is powerful. It is. The question is whether we will repent of whatever is hard, shallow, or crowded in us. Parents, what is your home being planted with this week? Students, what voice has your attention? Leaders, are we cultivating performance or transformation? Christ is not only inviting decisions. He is forming disciples. Let us ask the Spirit to break hard ground, deepen roots, clear thorns, and produce lasting fruit for the glory of God and the good of our city.",
